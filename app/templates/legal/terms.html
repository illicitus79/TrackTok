    <h2>1. Overview</h2>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>2. Accounts and Access</h2>
    <p>
      You must provide accurate account information and maintain the confidentiality of your login. You are responsible for actions taken under your account. We may suspend or terminate access for violation of these terms or misuse of the service.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>3. Tenant Data</h2>
    <p>
      Each tenant owns the data stored in their workspace. We process tenant data only to provide and improve the service, and as described in our Privacy Policy. You are responsible for ensuring the legality and accuracy of data you input.
    </p>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No unlawful, infringing, or harmful activities.</li>
      <li>No attempts to disrupt, probe, or bypass security or tenancy isolation.</li>
      <li>No uploading of malicious code or unauthorized personal data.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>5. Availability and Support</h2>
    <p>
      We aim for reliable service but do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. Maintenance, updates, or incidents may temporarily affect access. We provide support on a best-effort basis.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>6. Payment and Plans</h2>
    <p>
      If you subscribe to a paid plan, fees are billed in advance per the selected billing cycle. Fees are non-refundable except where required by law. We may change pricing with prior notice; continued use after notice constitutes acceptance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards appropriate for a multi-tenant expense platform. No system is perfectly secure; promptly notify us of suspected issues or unauthorized access.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Integrations or links to third-party services are provided for convenience. Their terms and privacy practices govern your use of those services.
    </p>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>9. Disclaimers and Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TrackTok is provided “as is.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Our aggregate liability is limited to fees paid in the preceding three months.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using TrackTok at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for breach, security risk, or misuse. Upon termination, your right to access the service ends, but Sections 3 and 9 survive.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>11. Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms. Material changes will be communicated via the app or email. Continued use after changes become effective means you accept the revised terms.
