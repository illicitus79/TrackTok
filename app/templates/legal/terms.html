  <h1 class="gradient-text">Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="text-muted">Last updated: {{ last_updated }}</p>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      TrackTok helps teams track expenses and budgets across projects. By using TrackTok, you agree to these Terms of Service and all applicable laws. If you use TrackTok on behalf of an organization, you confirm you have authority to bind that organization.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>2. Accounts and Access</h2>
    <p>
      You must provide accurate account information and maintain the confidentiality of your login. You are responsible for actions taken under your account. We may suspend or terminate access for violation of these terms, misuse of the service, or to protect the security of the platform.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>3. Service, Plans, and Limits</h2>
    <p>
      TrackTok may offer different plan tiers and feature limits (for example, limits on users, projects, accounts, or expenses). Plan details may be shown in the app and may change over time. Some features or tiers may be available as a preview, and “pricing coming soon” means paid pricing has not been finalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree to comply with the applicable limits of your plan. We may enforce limits through technical controls (for example, by preventing additional creation) and may suspend abusive usage that negatively impacts the service.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>4. Tenant Data and Your Content</h2>
    <p>
      Each tenant owns the data stored in their workspace. We process tenant data only to provide and improve the service, and as described in our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for the legality, accuracy, and appropriateness of any data or content you input or upload (including receipt images). You confirm you have the rights necessary to upload the content and that it does not violate any law or third-party rights.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No unlawful, infringing, or harmful activities.</li>
      <li>No attempts to disrupt, probe, or bypass security or tenancy isolation.</li>
      <li>No uploading of malicious code or unauthorized personal data.</li>
      <li>No use of the service to store sensitive data unless you have a lawful basis and appropriate safeguards.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>6. Availability and Support</h2>
    <p>
      We aim for reliable service but do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. Maintenance, updates, or incidents may temporarily affect access. We provide support on a best-effort basis.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>7. Payment and Billing</h2>
    <p>
      If you subscribe to a paid plan, fees (if any) are billed according to the plan details shown to you at purchase. Fees are non-refundable except where required by law. We may introduce or change pricing and plan features with prior notice; continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards appropriate for a multi-tenant expense platform. No system is perfectly secure; promptly notify us of suspected issues or unauthorized access.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Integrations or links to third-party services are provided for convenience. Their terms and privacy practices govern your use of those services.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>10. Disclaimers and Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TrackTok is provided “as is.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. TrackTok does not provide legal, tax, or financial advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill. Our aggregate liability for claims relating to the service is limited to the fees paid (if any) for the service during the three months immediately before the event giving rise to the claim.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using TrackTok at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for breach, security risk, misuse, or non-payment (if applicable). Upon termination, your right to access the service ends, but sections that by their nature should survive (including data handling and liability terms) will survive.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>12. Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms. Material changes will be communicated via the app or email. Continued use after changes become effective means you accept the revised terms.
    </p>
  </div>
