    <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>
      We process data to deliver the service, improve reliability and security, provide support, communicate important updates, and comply with legal obligations. We do not sell personal data.

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>4. Cookies and Session Data</h2>

      We use cookies or similar technologies as needed to keep you signed in, protect the service, and remember basic preferences. Your browser may let you control cookies; disabling cookies may affect functionality.

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We may share data with trusted processors (for example, hosting, email delivery, monitoring) bound by confidentiality and security commitments. We may disclose data if required by law or to protect our rights, users, or the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to appropriate protections.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We apply industry-standard safeguards for a multi-tenant platform, including encryption in transit, access controls, and monitoring. You are responsible for strong passwords and managing user access within your tenant.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain tenant data for as long as the account remains active. Upon account closure or a verified deletion request, we delete or return data within a reasonable period unless retention is required by law or needed to resolve disputes, enforce agreements, or protect the service.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export your personal data, and to object to certain processing. Contact us to exercise these rights; we may need to verify your identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tenant administrators may be able to manage or delete user accounts and workspace data from within the service. If you are a user within a tenant, you may need to contact your tenant administrator first.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Data may be processed in regions where we or our processors operate. We use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers where required.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>10. Children</h2>

      TrackTok is not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us to remove it.

  <div class="legal-section">
    <h2>11. Changes</h2>

      We may update this Policy. Material changes will be communicated via the app or email. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.
